# Enzyme-Kinetics---Activation-Model

This program is designed to efficiently extract data from Excel files and present it through a series of graphical analyses. Each Excel file provided contains twelve graphs, each displaying a linear segment followed by a plateau.

One objective of the program is to accurately identify and extract the linear portion of each graph, conduct a best-fit analysis, and then visually represent the slopes.

The final graph would be fitted with a Michaelis-Menten-derived equation to obtain the desired parameters.
